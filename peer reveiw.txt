Peer's project:

What is something you learned by reviewing your peer's project?
i didnt know there was some code that could rerun a program

What is something you saw in your peer's project that you would like to apply to your own programming projects?
the way they generated random input was and interesting idea that i would like to try
What suggestions would you have for your peer to improve his/her code?
make the code which moves the square and turn it into a function that can be reused instead of just the base code
also the if puzzle != perfectpuzzle will not work when the win condition happens, so a better way to check win was needed
the conrgadulations text was too big to fit the screen
What could have been clearer or better commented?
the random moving of the puzzle to create a non-finished version
Was there anything in the code that was confusing to you? If so, what?
not really
What is something he/she could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?
say that the only way to move the blocks is by clicking on them
Pay a compliment to your peer based on the quality of his/her code.
there was very little reused code and there were a lot of interesting ways that completed problems i never would have thought of
